<b>RESEARCH PAPERS</b>

* <b>Analysis of Collaborative Writing Processes Using Hidden Markov Models and Semantic Heuristics</b>
* It analysis the PROCESS of collaborative writing and predict writing performance
* Inspiration
 * Maybe I can try HMM in my semantic layer, see what kind of key components will lead to what kind of result
 * It's a good idea to record writing behaviour and do analysis, plus time/duration may be better
